# A Demo using the VoiceIt Avaya Orchestration Designer Plugin

A sample Avaya Orchestration Designer 7.x application that does demonstrate the functionality of voice biometric authentication by
using the VoiceIt&trade; Plug-in for Orchestration Designer.

The application will create a user based on the callers *session:ani* value and allow the caller to enroll in voice authentication.
Enrollment is the process of saying a phrase 3 times. Once enrollment is complete, the caller can then authenticate by speaking the
same phrase. If authentication is successful, the caller will have the option to remove their enrollments and re-enroll, or remove
their user account from the system.
